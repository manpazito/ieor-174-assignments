# setup
# number of batteries per box = 100
# each battery ~ N(1, 0.05^2)
# so total weight ~ Normal with mean = 100, std = sqrt(100)*0.05 = 0.5
# pick number of trials for Monte Carlo, like N = 200000

# Monte Carlo part
# 1. simulate N samples:
#    generate N x 100 normals with mean=1, sd=0.05
#    sum along axis=1 to get total weight of each box
# 2. (a) probability total weight > 101
#    just count how many > 101 and divide by N
# 3. (b) conditional expectation of extra fee
#    fee = max(X - 100, 0)
#    take mean of fee values but only over samples with X > 100

# Analytical part
# need pdf and cdf for standard normal
# (a) analytic prob = 1 - Phi((101-100)/0.5)
# (c) formula for E[(X-100)+] = sigma*phi(z) + (mu-100)*(1 - Phi(z))
# where z = (100-mu)/sigma
# (b) then conditional = that expectation divided by P(X>100)

# print out MC results and analytic results side by side
