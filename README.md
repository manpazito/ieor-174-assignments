# IEOR 174 â€“ Assignments

This repository contains solutions and materials for the IEOR 174 course (Fall 2025) at UC Berkeley, taught by Prof. Zeyu Zheng. Assignments are organized into folders. Each subproblem is worked on based on this current format: `Assignment<num>\hw<num>-<subproblem>.ipynb`.

This repo also includes a notebook compiler to merge notebooks together for a final submission named `notebook_compiler.py` that when ran, will prompt to insert an assingment number, and will create a file in the respective Assignment folder with a merge of all the assigment subproblems with an automatically generated title.

Work done by **Manuel Martinez Garcia** and **Ali Younis**.
